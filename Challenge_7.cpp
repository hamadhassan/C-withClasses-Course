    vehicle taxes. Vehicle taxes are based on two pieces of information; the price of the vehicle and

    Motorcycle M 6%  Electric E 8%  Sedan S 10%  Van V 12%  Truck T 15%
    After the tax has been calculated, the program should display the following on the screen;
    The final price on a vehicle of type xxx after adding the tax is $xxx.
    with xxx replaced by the vehicle type and $xxx with the final price.
    Your job is to write a function
    float taxCalculator(char type, float price);
    and then write the main function for taking the input from the user and then displaying
    the final output. */
